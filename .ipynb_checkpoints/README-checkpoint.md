This project analyzes TikTok comments from a video discussing whether maternal acetaminophen use is linked to autism and how the public reacts to scientific explanations about this topic. We collected a sample of comments and created two coding concepts. Concept 1 identifies comments that support Trump or support the idea that Tylenol causes autism. Concept 2 identifies comments that support the scientific community, reject the causal claim, or show trust in the video author’s explanation. We used human coding and then developed a prompt for an LLM to code the full dataset in a consistent way.

After coding all comments, we examined patterns in how often each type of comment appeared and how users engaged with them. Comments rejecting the Tylenol-autism link or supporting scientific thinking appeared at a similar rate to comments that endorsed the causal claim or repeated misinformation. However, these two groups behaved differently in terms of engagement. Comments aligned with science received more likes, showing that viewers generally reacted positively to them. Comments supporting the causal link or attacking scientific credibility received more replies, which means they sparked more discussion or conflict. Because TikTok tends to promote comments with many replies, these comments may get more visibility even if they are not the most positively received. We also found that older users are more likely to write Concept 2 comments, while younger users show more variation and engage more with Concept 1 and neutral comments. This suggests that trust in scientific research increases somewhat with age.
